abstract = {Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks will provide one of the missing connections between the Internet and the physical world. One of the fundamental problems in sensor networks is the calculation of coverage. Exposure is directly related to coverage in that it is a measure of how well an object, moving on an arbitrary path, can be observed by the sensor network over a period of time.In addition to the informal definition, we formally define exposure and study its properties. We have developed an efficient and effective algorithm for exposure calculation in sensor networks, specifically for finding minimal exposure paths. The minimal exposure path provides valuable information about the worst case exposure-based coverage in sensor networks. The algorithm works for any given distribution of sensors, sensor and intensity models, and characteristics of the network. It provides an unbounded level of accuracy as a function of run time and storage. We provide an extensive collection of experimental results and study the scaling behavior of exposure and the proposed algorithm for its calculation.},

abstract = {From the Publisher:The updated new edition of the classic Introduction to Algorithms is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in algorithms or data structures. Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. In its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. As in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds.  Each chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25\% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning.}

abstract = {We give a deterministic polynomial-time method for finding a set cover in a set system (X, ) of dual VC-dimensiond such that the size of our cover is at most a factor ofO(d log(dc)) from the optimal size,c. For constant VC-dimensional set systems, which are common in computational geometry, our method gives anO(logc) approximation factor. This improves the previous (log X ) bound of the greedy method and challenges recent complexity-theoretic lower bounds for set covers (which do not make any assumptions about the VC-dimension). We give several applications of our method to computational geometry, and we show that in some cases, such as those arising in three-dimensional polytope approximation and two-dimensional disk covering, we can quickly findO(c)-sized covers.},

Based on ideas due to Vapnik and Chervonenkis, we introduce the concept of an -net of a set of points for an abstract set of ranges and give sufficient conditions that a random sample is an -net with any desired probability. Using these results, we demonstrate how random samples can be used to build a partition-tree structure that achieves the above query time.},

abstract = {Many novel multimedia systems and applications use visual sensor arrays. An important issue in designing sensor arrays is the appropriate placement of the visual sensors such that they achieve a predefined goal. In this paper we focus on the placement with respect to maximizing coverage or achieving coverage at a certain resolution. We identify and consider four different problems: maximizing coverage subject to a given number of cameras (a) or a maximum total price of the sensor array (b), optimizing camera poses given fixed locations (c), and minimizing the cost of a sensor array given a minimally required percentage of coverage (d). To solve these problems, we propose different algorithms. Our approaches can be subdivided into algorithms which give a global optimum solution and heuristics which solve the problem within reasonable time and memory consumption at the cost of not necessarily determining the global optimum. We also present a user-interface to enter and edit the spaces under analysis, the optimization problems as well as the other setup parameters. The different algorithms are experimentally evaluated and results are presented. The results show that the algorithms work well and are suited for different practical applications. For the final paper it is planned to have the user interface running as a web service.},

abstract = {In conventional sensor networks, the sensors often are based on omni-sensing model. However, directional sensing range and sensors are great application chances, typically in video sensor networks. Thus, the directional sensor network also demands novel solutions, especially for deployment policy and sensor’s scheduling. Toward this end, this paper evaluates the requirements of deploying directional sensors for a given coverage probability. Moreover, the paper proposes how to solve the connectivity problem for randomly deployed sensors under the directional communication model. The paper proposes a method for checking and repairing the connectivity of directional sensor networks for two typical cases. We design efficient protocols to implement our idea. A set of experiments are also performed to prove the effectivity of our solution. The results of this paper can be also used to solve the coverage problem of traditional sensor networks as a special case.},
